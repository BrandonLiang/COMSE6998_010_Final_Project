## COMSE6998_010_Final_Project

Author: [Ruizhe Li (rl3070)](https://github.com/rzli6) \& [Ruochen Nan (rn2498)](https://github.com/marina32).

## Introduction
This project applies order-encoding methods and deep learning methods to do the short-term stock price prediction. Using [NYSE TAQ data](https://www.nyse.com/market-data/historical) on Oct 7th, 2019 in the A-CNN, A-CNN+ and A-LSTM model solves the classification problem of two classes (Up, Down) and the mid-price is the target of prediction.

## Implementation Details
**Dataset:** TAQ NYSE Equities on Oct 7th, 2019

**Hardware:** 2vCPUs | 13 GB memory | 1 x NVIDIA Tesla P100 / Tesla T4

**Platform:** Google Cloud Platform / Colab

**Framework:** Tensorflow 2

## Models
This project includes below models:

### Data processing
For example you want to analyse the stocks which have 'ABCD' and 'EFG' as stock ticker symbols. You will use 'ABCD' and 'EFGH' as symbol and input your path of orignal data:
```
path = 'your path'
symbol = ['ABCD', 'EFGH']
```
Then just follow the whole automatic data processing and gain models. 
```
for symbol in symbols:
    X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = data_processing(path, symbol)
    _, seq_length, n_features = X_train.shape
    test_cnn(symbol)
    test_lstm(symbol)
```

### CNN:
- Embedding of order-type
- (with/without) Average pooling
- Convolutional layers (with/without inception module)
- Softmax classifier

And tested models 
- with/without average pooling
- with/without inception structures

If you want to see the plot of the model, you first set (kernel size, number of filters) and average pooling size if you want multiple average pooling layers using the below codes in our scripts:
```
filter_fk = [(3, 20), (5, 20), (7, 20)]
avg_pool_size = [5, 10]
model = build_CNN_model(filter_fk, avg_pool_size)
plot_model(model)
```

### LSTM:
- Embedding
- Several LSTM layers
- Batch-norm and dropout layers used in between
- Softmax classifier on the top

And tested the LSTM model 
- with different layers
- with/without average pooling layers


If you want to see the plot of the model, you first set average pooling size if you want multiple average pooling layers and the number of layers in LSTM model using the below codes in our scripts:
```
avg_pool_size_lst = [0, 5, 10]
n_lstm_lst = 2
model = build_LSTM_model(avg_pool_size_lst, n_lstm_lst)
plot_model(model)
```
## Results
**CNN:**
For CNN models, we can achieve a 60% F1 score. However, average pooling and larger kernel sizes do not work, because our dataset only contains high frequency market orders, where low resolution information is not quite useful. Our parallel-kernel model can give similar performance as small-kernel models. It is expected to give better results on dataset containing both high frequency and low frequency data.

**LSTM:**
On the other hand, LSTM models can achieve 70-80% F1 score, which is much better than CNN models. For the same reason, average pooling does not work. We compared 1-layer model versus 2-layer model, and found the 2-layer model is easier to be overfitted. 1-layer model is better because it gives similar results and could be trained much faster. But both 1-layer and 2-layer models are much slower than CNN models, thus it could be a bottleneck in a real-world setting.
