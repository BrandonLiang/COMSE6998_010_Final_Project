## Introduction
This project applies order-encoding methods and deep learning methods to do the short-term stock price prediction. Using [NYSE TAQ data](https://www.nyse.com/market-data/historical) on Oct 7th, 2019 in the A-CNN, A-CNN+ and A-LSTM model solves the classification problem of two classes (Up, Down) and the mid-price is the target of prediction.

## Implementation Details
**Dataset:** TAQ NYSE Equities on Oct 7th, 2019

**Hardware:** 2vCPUs | 13 GB memory | 1 x NVIDIA Tesla P100 / Tesla T4

**Platform:** Google Cloud Platform / Colab

**Framework:** Tensorflow 2

## Models
This project includes below models:

**CNN:**
- Embedding of order-type
- (with/without) Average pooling
- Convolutional layers (with/without inception module)
- Softmax classifier

And tested models 
- with/without average pooling
- with/without inception structures

**LSTM:**
- Embedding
- Several LSTM layers
- Batch-norm and dropout layers used in between
- Softmax classifier on the top

And tested the LSTM model 
- with different layers
- with/without average pooling layers

## Results
**CNN:**
For CNN models, we can achieve a 60% F1 score. However, average pooling and larger kernel sizes do not work, because our dataset only contains high frequency market orders, where low resolution information is not quite useful. Our parallel-kernel model can give similar performance as small-kernel models. It is expected to give better results on dataset containing both high frequency and low frequency data.

**LSTM:**
On the other hand, LSTM models can achieve 70-80% F1 score, which is much better than CNN models. For the same reason, average pooling does not work. We compared 1-layer model versus 2-layer model, and found the 2-layer model is easier to be overfitted. 1-layer model is better because it gives similar results and could be trained much faster. But both 1-layer and 2-layer models are much slower than CNN models, thus it could be a bottleneck in a real-world setting.
